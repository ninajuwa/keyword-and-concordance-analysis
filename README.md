# Keyword analysis
This a repository including the data and R code for the keyword analysis.
The keyword analysis tests which motion verbs occur significantly more often in a target corpus (here music criticism) compared to a reference corpus (here the BNC).

The data includes verb lemmas and their frequencies in the music criticism corpus and the BNC.

The R script presents the code for the statistical analysis.
